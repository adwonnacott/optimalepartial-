<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;">Hi&nbsp;{{{Recipient.FirstName}}},<br />
<br />
It looks as though you haven't had a blood test in the last 6 months. We require a recent blood test on record to ensure you are safe to continue treatment.<br />
<br />
If you have completely run out of medication then we can check with the doctor whether we can send out a small amount whilst you get this organised. You do need to book it as soon as possible though as&nbsp;our doctors will not supply further medication after this without the necessary blood test.<br />
<br />
If you have had a test from somewhere else within the last 6 months please send us a copy for your file and for the doctor to review.<br />
<br />
You can order the test here: <a href="https://www.optimale.co.uk/product/testosterone-monitoring-blood-test/">Testosterone monitoring test</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Please ensure the test is taken as a trough reading, which means taking the test before your next scheduled testosterone injection.<br />
<br />
You can organise a clinic visit on our clinic&nbsp;page here: <a href="https://www.optimale.co.uk/product/clinic-visit/">Clinic visit</a><br />
<br />
Please let us know if you have any questions.<br />
<br />
Many thanks,<br />
The Optimale Team</body>

Hi ,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Your results are back from the laboratory. Your total&nbsp;and&nbsp;free testosterone levels&nbsp;are low and likely to be causing your symptoms.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Please find your results attached. Are you interested in getting treatment for this? I can refer to our doctor who will advise on whether you are suitable for testosterone replacement therapy.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Please let me know if you have any questions about your test or TRT.

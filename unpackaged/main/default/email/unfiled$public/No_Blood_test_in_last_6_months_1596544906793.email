<p>Hi&nbsp;{{{Account.FirstName}}}</p>

<p>It looks as though you haven't had a blood test in the last 6 months. We require a recent blood test on record to ensure you are safe to continue treatment, this is required before we can send out a full supply of your prescription for you. However, we can send a smaller amount to last you whilst you get a test organised. If you have had a test from somewhere else within the last 6 months please send us a copy for your file and for the Dr to review. We understand that the past few months have made this difficult but we also need to ensure that patients are not being put at risk and are safe to continue treatment.</p>

<p>Clinics are now open to allow venous tests, we also have nurses available in some locations. If you have someone available to take your blood test then please let us know or ask us if you would like information on areas nearby.</p>

<p>Please get back to us and let us know if you require a smaller amount of medication to be sent out whilst you organise a blood test.</p>

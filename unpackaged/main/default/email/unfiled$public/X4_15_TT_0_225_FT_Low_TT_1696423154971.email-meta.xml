    <subject>Your Optimale Blood Test Result</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {{{Blood_Test__c.Contact_Name__c}}}, 

We have received the analysis of your blood test from the laboratory. The results indicate that you have low total testosterone levels, which can cause low testosterone symptoms.

You can access your blood test results below:

View Results &lt; {{{Blood_Test__c.PDF_URL__c}}} &gt; 

The password is: {{{Blood_Test__c.PDF_Password__c}}}

In the result you’ll see 4 values. I’ve put an explanation of each below. The key one is your total testosterone.

Anything below 12 nmol/L is considered a low result for a man of your age who is experiencing symptoms. Levels between 12nmol/L and 15nmol/L may be eligible for TRT at our doctor&#39;s discretion.

We specialise in helping men who have low levels and symptoms to get back on track, so hopefully we can help.

What’s next?

Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT) is a fantastic treatment option, but we are very careful in assessing suitability. If you are interested in treatment, we are required by regulations to do:

 - An enhanced blood test. This checks over 40 biomarkers (more than the finger prick test that you’ve done) and needs to be administered by a nurse. You can visit a Superdrug, Randox or a Goodbody clinic to do this, or if you know a nurse you can get them to do it for you. Here’s a bit more info on this stage.
 - A possible prostate examination. If you are 45 years old or older, and post a PSA reading that is within acceptable range for your age, we may not require a physical check of your prostate. We can arrange for a member of the team to give you a call to go over some quick questions.
 - A consultation with a TRT-specialist Doctor. The doctor will determine the best treatment protocol to alleviate your symptoms, given your blood test results and factoring in any other health considerations.

If you are interested in continuing towards treatment, you can:

Order an enhanced blood test here &lt; https://www.optimale.co.uk/product/enhanced-testosterone-blood-test/ &gt; 

You can order the blood test and clinic visit at the same time, however, please wait for the test kit to arrive in the post before you book a date and time for your sample to be taken, unless you book with Randox who have test kits on site.

If you’d like to discuss your results further, there are explanations of the 4 values below, but please reply to this email and we will be more than happy to help you with any questions.

Many thanks,

Optimale

Explained: The 4 Values in your Test

Albumin - this protein binds to testosterone in the blood, limiting how much testosterone is available for use by the body. A higher level of Albumin will mean less testosterone is readily available, which is called Free Testosterone.

SHBG - short for Sex Hormone Binding Globulin. This protein helps with transporting testosterone in the bloodstream. If levels are too high then free testosterone available to the body will be lower.

Free testosterone- this is the testosterone available for the body to use. If total testosterone is normal but this is low, then you may still have symptoms of low testosterone.

Total testosterone- this is the overall testosterone level in the blood and indicates how much testosterone your body produces overall. If low then you may experience symptoms of low testosterone.

Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT) is a fantastic treatment option, but we are very careful in assessing suitability. If you are interested in treatment, we are required by regulations to do:

 - An enhanced blood test. This checks 44 biomarkers (39 more than the finger prick test that you’ve done) and needs to be administered by a nurse. You can visit a Superdrug, Randox or a Goodbody clinic to do this, or if you know a nurse you can get them to do it for you. Here’s a bit more info on this stage.
 - A possible prostate examination if you are over 45. If you are 45 years old or older, and post a PSA reading of &lt;2ng/ml we may not require a physical check of your prostate. We will be able to ascertain your PSA levels once you&#39;ve completed the Enhanced test and will be in a better position to advise further.
 - A consultation with a TRT-specialist Doctor. The doctor will determine the best treatment protocol to alleviate your symptoms, given your blood test results and factoring in any other health considerations.

    <textOnly>Hi {{{Blood_Test__c.Contact_Name__c}}}, 

We have received the analysis of your blood test from the laboratory. The results indicate that you have very low testosterone levels, which is likely to be causing your symptoms. 

You can access your blood test results below:

The password is: {{{Blood_Test__c.PDF_Password__c}}}

As your Total Testosterone level is below 5.4nmol/l, the regulations state that we should investigate these further to ensure there is not another condition causing it, and to make sure you are safe to start treatment.

Have you taken steroids, or testosterone boosters recently? These may cause some suppression of your testosterone production and lead to a very low level like yours are here. Other causes may be previous testicular damage or longer term opioid use.

In the results, you’ll see 4 values. I’ve put an explanation of each below. The key one is your total testosterone. Anything below 15 nmol/L is considered a low result for a man of your age who is experiencing symptoms. Yours are quite a bit lower than this.

What’s next?

Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT) is a fantastic treatment option, but we are very careful in assessing suitability. If you are interested in treatment, we are required by regulations to:

 1. Answer the aboveso we know whether we need to do further investigations.
 2. An enhanced blood test.This checks 44 biomarkers (39 more than the fingerpick test that you’ve done) and needs to be administered by a nurse. You can visit a Superdrug Randox or a Goodbody clinic to do this, or if you know a nurse you can get them to do it for you. Here’s a bit more info on this stage. &lt; https://www.optimale.co.uk/trt-uk#which-blood-tests-do-i-need-before-starting-trt-in-the-uk? &gt; 
 3. A possible prostate examination.If you are 45 years old or older, and post a PSA reading that is within acceptable range for your age, we may not require a physical check of your prostate. We can arrange for a member of the team to give you a call to go over some quick questions.
 4. A consultation with a TRT-specialist Doctor.The doctor will determine the best treatment protocol to alleviate your symptoms, given your blood test results and factoring in any other health considerations.

There are explanations of the 4 values below, and I’m always more than happy to help you with any questions about your results.

Many thanks,

Optimale

Explained: The 4 Values in your Test

Albumin - this protein binds to testosterone in the blood, limiting how much testosterone is available for use by the body. A higher level of Albumin will mean less testosterone is readily available, which is called Free Testosterone.

SHBG - short for Sex Hormone Binding Globulin. This protein helps with transporting testosterone in the bloodstream. If levels are too high then free testosterone available to the body will be lower.

Free testosterone- this is the testosterone available for the body to use. If total testosterone is normal but this is low, then you may still have symptoms of low testosterone.

Total testosterone- this is the overall testosterone level in the blood and indicates how much testosterone your body produces overall. If low then you may experience symptoms of low testosterone.

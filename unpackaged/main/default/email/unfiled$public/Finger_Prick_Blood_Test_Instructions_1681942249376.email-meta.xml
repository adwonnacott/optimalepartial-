Dear {{{Recipient.FirstName}}}

Thank you for your finger-prick blood test order.

Please note the following important instructions for taking and returning your sample:

We have placed your order and you should receive a finger-prick home testing kit in the coming days.

It is important that you take your blood sample on a Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday and send it back the same day, because the testing labs are closed on the weekend.

Failure to follow this advice will increase the likelihood of your blood sample failing, due to the blood being too old to analyse.

Here is a video that you might find useful for the blood test:

Many thanks,
